//US County Business Patterns

a) You need to create the following databases:

	1) USCountyBusinessPatternsStaging
	2) USCountyBusinessPatterns
	3) USCountyBusinessPatternsDW

b) I have not provided the source text files for County Business Patterns


	http://www.census.gov/econ/cbp/download/

	The reason is total size of the text files is about 3 GB.
	
	You have to download the files yourself..
	

c) In the USCountyBusinessPatterns.zip

	You will find 
		1) County text files
		2) Naics text files
		3) Table Creation scripts for all the three databases
